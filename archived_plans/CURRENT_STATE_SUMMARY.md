# ClinicPro Current State Summary

## Branch Information
- **Current Branch**: `main`
- **Existing Branches**:
  - `archive/pre-auth-refactor`
  - `feature/auth-paystack-refactor`
  - `clean-branch`

## Architecture Overview

### Current Dependencies
- Phoenix Framework 1.7.21
- Phoenix LiveView 0.18 (downgraded for compatibility)
- Ash Framework for domain modeling
- Guardian JWT for authentication
- Paystack for payment processing
- PostgreSQL for database

### Authentication System
- **Patient Portal**: OTP-based authentication with rate limiting
- **Doctor Portal**: Email/password authentication with SHA-256 hashing
- **Admin Portal**: Simple authentication system

### Payment System
- Paystack integration as primary payment gateway
- Multi-tenant architecture with clinic-specific configurations
- Incomplete M-Pesa modules still present in codebase

### Current Issues
1. **Compilation Warnings**: Numerous warnings about unused variables, undefined modules, and functions
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Some test failures related to Mox configuration
3. **Component Structure**: Mix of traditional controllers/views and newer component patterns
4. **Code Organization**: Overloaded modules with multiple responsibilities

## Test Status

Based on compilation output, there are several warnings that need attention:

1. **Unused Variables**: Many variables with leading underscores that are actually being used
2. **Undefined Modules**: References to missing modules like `Clinicpro.Paystack.Http`
3. **Virtual Meetings Issues**: Adapter implementation problems
4. **Route Path Warnings**: Issues with template routing

## Directory Structure

Current structure shows a mix of traditional Phoenix MVC and newer patterns:

```
lib/
├── clinicpro/ (Domain modules)
└── clinicpro_web/ (Web interface)
    ├── controllers/ (Traditional controllers)
    ├── components/ (Some HEEx components)
    ├── views/ (Traditional views)
    └── templates/ (HEEx templates)
```

## Recommendations for Refactor

1. **Preserve Working Functionality**: Current authentication and payment systems are functional
2. **Address Compilation Issues**: Fix warnings before adding complexity
3. **Gradual Migration**: Move from controllers to LiveView components incrementally
4. **Maintain Multi-tenant Architecture**: Ensure clinic isolation is preserved
5. **Improve Test Coverage**: Address test infrastructure issues

This baseline will help measure progress during the refactor process.
